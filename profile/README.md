## Get Started

To get an idea what `tidyomics` means, here are some getting started
material and tutorials:

* [Tidy transcriptomics manifesto](https://tidyomics.github.io/tidyomicsBlog/post/2021-07-07-tidy-transcriptomics-manifesto/)
* [Tidy ranges tutorial](https://tidyomics.github.io/tidy-ranges-tutorial/)
* ...

You might also check out recent workshops:

* [Tidy genomic and transcriptomic single-cell analyses at BioC2023](https://tidyomics.github.io/tidyomicsWorkshopBioc2023/articles/tidyGenomicsTranscriptomics.html)
* ...

## Join the Conversation
