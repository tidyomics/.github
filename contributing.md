# Contributing to `tidyomics`

## General steps to making contributions to the tidyomics ecosystem

1. Check the open challenges page, or ask one of the community members
   about adding a new open challenge
2. Reach out to a package developer, either through an Issue, or on
   Bioconductor community Slack, `#tidiness_in_bioc` channel
3. Discuss building a pull request, or developing a stand-alone
   package

## Overview of what makes a tidyomics package

* We are not re-implementing tidy or Bioconductor functionality, nor
  are we creating new classes to replace Bioconductor classes. All of
  the tidyomics packages leverage existing functions and classes, and
  simply provide an interface (an API) between tidy verbs and
  Bioconductor objects.
